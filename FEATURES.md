## 1. Gameplay

### Ball Physics & Movement
- Arcade physics with circular collision body (radius 10px)
- Perfect bounce (bounce factor 1,1) off walls and bricks
- World bounds collision on top, left, and right walls — **bottom is open** (ball falls out = life lost)
- Minimum speed enforcement prevents the ball from getting "stuck" going too slowly
- Minimum vertical velocity guard prevents boring near-horizontal loops
- Launch angle randomized between -120° and -60° (upward arc)
- Base speed: 400px/s, modified per level via `ballSpeedMultiplier`

### Paddle Mechanics
- Follows mouse/touch position with smooth interpolation (lerp factor 0.15)
- Clamped to screen bounds (can't leave the play area)
- Collision angle system: ball bounce angle is computed from where it hits the paddle
  - Center hit → straight up (-90°)
  - Left edge → steep left (-150°)
  - Right edge → steep right (-30°)
  - Smooth linear interpolation between edges
- Width: 120px base, expandable to 180px via Cake power-up
- Wobbly mode (Drinks debuff): sinusoidal offset applied to paddle target position

### Brick Types & HP System
| Type | Base HP | Score/Hit | Drop Chance | Color |
|------|---------|-----------|-------------|-------|
| **Present** | 1–3 | 10 | 15% | Pink |
| **Piñata** | 1–3 | 15 | 25% | Orange |
| **Balloon** | 1–3 | 20 | 30% | Cyan |

- Bricks display health indicator dots (1–3 dots on the brick face)
- Texture changes on damage to reflect remaining HP
- Hit animation: quick scale punch (1.1x / 0.9y) + white flash
- Destroy animation: scale to 0 + fade out with Back easing

### Level Progression
**10 levels** with named themes and unique brick layouts:

| # | Name | Speed | Drop Boost | Design |
|---|------|-------|------------|--------|
| 1 | The Warm-Up | 1.0× | 35% | Simple 3-row grid, close to paddle |
| 2 | Dance Floor | 1.0× | 32% | Checkerboard pattern |
| 3 | Gift Wrapped | 1.05× | 30% | Inverted pyramid with HP scaling |
| 4 | Balloon Bonanza | 1.08× | 30% | Two sections with gap corridor |
| 5 | Piñata Panic | 1.12× | 28% | Dense wall with vertical channels |
| 6 | The Maze | 1.15× | 28% | Pockets and passages |
| 7 | Disco Fever | 1.18× | 38% | Three distinct sections, high drops |
| 8 | Sugar Rush | 1.22× | 35% | Vertical columns creating chambers |
| 9 | Last Call | 1.28× | 32% | Fortress: tough core, soft shell |
| 10 | Grand Finale | 1.35× | 40% | Full vertical space, max chaos |

- Layout system: 10-column grid, bricks placed by (x, y) grid coordinates
- Ball speed scales by `1.0× → 1.35×` from level 1 to 10
- Level complete when all bricks are destroyed (countActive === 0)
- After level 10 → win state + Endless Mode unlocked

### Endless Mode
Unlocked after completing the 10-level Story Mode campaign. Features infinite procedurally generated waves with escalating difficulty.

#### Unlock Condition
- Complete all 10 Story Mode levels
- Unlock persisted to localStorage (`genos-block-party-endless-unlocked`)
- Celebration overlay displayed on first unlock

#### Procedural Generation
- Uses seeded random number generator (mulberry32) for consistent wave layouts
- Generates 20–40 bricks per wave depending on difficulty
- **Pattern types**: Scatter, Symmetric, Fortress, Maze, Clusters, Rows
- Pattern selection weighted by wave number (easier patterns early, harder later)

#### Difficulty Scaling
| Parameter | Formula | Range |
|-----------|---------|-------|
| Brick Count | 20 + min(wave × 2, 20) | 20 → 40 |
| Average HP | 1 + floor(wave / 10) | 1 → 3 |
| Grid Density | 0.3 + min(wave × 0.02, 0.4) | 30% → 70% |
| Ball Speed | 1.0 + min(wave × 0.03, 0.5) | 1.0× → 1.5× |

#### Wave Difficulty Tiers
- **Waves 1–5 (Easy)**: Sparse layouts, mostly Presents (low HP), simple patterns
- **Waves 6–15 (Medium)**: Mixed density, Balloons and Piñatas appear, varied patterns
- **Waves 16+ (Hard)**: Dense layouts, HP 2–3 average, fortress and maze patterns

#### Checkpoint System
- Checkpoint every 5 waves (wave 5, 10, 15, 20...)
- Visual celebration on checkpoint waves ("🎉 CHECKPOINT! 🎉")
- Checkpoint waves use simpler patterns as a "breather"
- Checkpoint number displayed on Game Over screen

#### Endless Mode Leaderboard
- Separate leaderboard from Story Mode (`genos-block-party-endless-leaderboard`)
- Stores wave reached alongside score
- High score entry includes wave number

#### Currency Bonus
- Base currency from score (same formula as Story Mode)
- **Wave bonus**: +3 coins per wave reached
- Example: Reaching wave 20 = base currency + 60 bonus coins

#### Mode Selection
- New Mode Select screen accessible from Menu → Start Game
- **Story Mode**: 10-level campaign (always available)
- **Endless Mode**: Shows 🔒 lock icon + "Beat Story Mode to unlock" until unlocked
- After unlock: Shows personal best wave record

### Score System & Multiplier
- Points earned per brick hit (not per brick destroyed) — **10 / 15 / 20** depending on type
- **MultiplierSystem** (`src/systems/MultiplierSystem.ts`) — extracted for testability:
  - `getValue()` — current multiplier value
  - `increment(currentTime)` — called on brick hit, uses diminishing returns: `+0.15 × (1 / currentMultiplier)`
  - `update(currentTime, deltaMs)` — handles time-based decay
  - `reset()` — returns to base value (called on life loss or level transition)
  - `applyToScore(points)` — multiplies and floors points
- **Multiplier mechanics** (1.0× to 5.0× cap):
  - Each brick hit increments the multiplier with diminishing returns
  - Decays after 1 second of no hits (`DECAY_DELAY_MS`)
  - Decay rate scales with multiplier level (low multiplier decays slowly, high decays fast)
  - Resets to 1.0× on life loss or level transition
  - UI shows multiplier when ≥ 1.1× with color coding: yellow → orange → red

### Lives System
- Start with **3 lives**
- Lose a life when all balls fall off the bottom
- Last life triggers **danger mode**: pulsing red vignette + spark trail on ball + slow-motion flash
- Game over at 0 lives

---

## 2. Power-Ups

### Drop System
- Each brick type has its own base drop chance (Present 15%, Piñata 25%, Balloon 30%)
- Drop rolls happen **per damage point** — a fireball dealing 3 damage rolls 3 times independently
- Power-up type selected via **weighted random**: each type has a `dropWeight` value
- Power-ups fall at 150px/s with wobble (rotation) and pulsing scale animations
- Collected on paddle overlap; plays collect animation (scale up + fade)
- Power Ball doubles all drop chances (capped at 100%)
- Electric Ball AOE hits have a **50% drop penalty** on their rolls

### Power-Up Types

| Power-Up | Emoji | Duration | Weight | Effect |
|----------|-------|----------|--------|--------|
| **Balloon** | 🎈 | 10s | 20 | Slow ball — velocity scaled to 60% **immediately**, min speed halved |
| **Cake** | 🎂 | 15s | 15 | Wide paddle — 1.5× width for duration |
| **Drinks** | 🍹 | 8s | 15 | Wobbly paddle — sinusoidal offset (debuff!) |
| **Disco** | 🪩 | Instant | 10 | Multi-ball — spawns 2 extra balls at current ball's position |
| **Mystery** | ❓ | Varies | 10 | Random — rolls any other power-up type (uniform, excludes Mystery) |
| **Power Ball** | 💪 | 12s | 12 | Doubles power-up drop chance from all bricks |
| **Fireball** | 🔥 | 10s | 10 | Piercing ball with stacking damage (see below) |
| **Electric Ball** | ⚡ | 8s | 12 | 1.5× speed + AOE damage to adjacent bricks |
| **DJ Scratch** | 🧲 | 15s | 12 | Magnet paddle — ball sticks on contact, click to release |
| **Confetti Cannon** | 🎊 | Instant | 10 | Fires confetti at 5-8 random bricks for 1 damage each |
| **Conga Line** | 💃 | 8s | 8 | Trailing ghost balls deal damage to bricks |
| **Spotlight** | 🔦 | 8s | 8 | Gentle homing toward nearest brick |
| **Dance Floor** | 🪩 | Instant | 10 | Shuffles all bricks to random grid positions |

### Fireball Stacking
- Collecting multiple Fireballs during active duration **stacks the level** (1 → 2 → 3 → ...)
- Timer resets on each collection
- Damage equals fireball level (level 3 = 3 damage per hit)
- **Piercing**: if fireball level ≥ brick HP, ball passes through without bouncing
- Visual intensity caps at level 3 (3 tiers of flame particle effects + smoke trail)

### Electric Ball Details
- Ball speed boosted 1.5× — **applies immediately on collection** (velocity recalculated mid-flight)
- On every brick hit (not just destruction), damages all **cardinal-adjacent** bricks (N/S/E/W)
- AOE hits deal 1 damage each, give 50% score, and have 50% reduced drop chance
- Lightning arc visual drawn to each adjacent brick with jagged bolt + particle impact
- Propagates to new balls spawned during the effect (via Disco)

### DJ Scratch (Magnet Paddle) Details
- Collecting activates magnetic paddle for 15 seconds
- On paddle collision while active, ball stops and sticks to paddle surface
- Ball follows paddle horizontally while stuck
- Click/tap to release all stuck balls (launches at random upward angle)
- Works with multi-ball — each ball sticks individually on contact
- When effect expires, any remaining stuck balls auto-release
- Timer refreshes if collected again while active
- Uses existing Scratch SFX on ball catch

### Conga Line Details
- Ball spawns 3 trailing ghost copies at 300ms intervals (positions from 300ms, 600ms, 900ms ago)
- Ghost balls are semi-transparent (alpha 0.5→0.3) with magenta tint
- Ghosts track the ball's position history and follow its path with delay
- When a ghost overlaps a brick, it deals 1 damage (ghosts pass through, don't bounce)
- Damage triggers score, multiplier increment, and power-up drop rolls
- Effect lasts 8 seconds, then ghosts fade out gracefully (300ms fade)
- Works with multi-ball — each ball gets its own set of ghosts
- Propagates to new balls spawned during the effect (via Disco)
- Ball lost: clears that ball's ghosts immediately
- Timer refreshes if collected again while active

### Spotlight Details
- Ball gently curves toward the nearest brick while the effect is active
- **Steering algorithm**: On each frame, calculates angle to nearest brick and adjusts velocity by max ~2.8° per frame
- Subtle homing — player still has control over general direction, but ball "drifts" toward bricks
- **Visual effects**:
  - Golden glow and tint on ball (0xffd700)
  - Light cone/beam emanating from ball in its direction of travel
  - Trailing golden particles with sparkle effects
- Effect lasts 8 seconds
- Works with multi-ball — each ball independently homes toward its nearest brick
- Propagates to new balls spawned during the effect (via Disco)
- Timer refreshes if collected again while active

### Dance Floor Details
- **Instant effect**: On collection, all active bricks shuffle to random positions on the grid
- **Animation**: Bricks animate smoothly to new positions (~450ms, Back easeOut)
- **Visual effects**:
  - Hot pink + white screen flash (disco theme)
  - Bricks wobble/rotate during movement
  - Camera shake on activation
- **Grid**: 10-column × 12-row valid positions (same as level layouts)
- **No overlapping**: Each brick gets a unique random position
- **Physics sync**: StaticBody positions update after animation completes
- Plays party horn SFX on activation

### Mystery Power-Up
- Shows "???" feedback on collection
- After 300ms delay, reveals the actual effect with its proper popup text
- Can resolve to any power-up type except Mystery itself (uniform distribution)

### Effect Propagation (Multi-Ball)
- **Fireball**: propagates to newly spawned balls AND applies to all existing balls
- **Electric Ball**: propagates to new balls AND applies to all existing balls
- **Balloon**: applies to all existing balls but does NOT propagate to newly spawned ones
- **Conga Line**: propagates to new balls AND applies to all existing balls
- **Spotlight**: propagates to new balls AND applies to all existing balls
- Disco spawns get the Disco Sparkle visual effect on all active balls

### Visual Feedback System
Each power-up has per-type feedback on collection:
- **Popup text**: Large centered text ("FIREBALL!", "WIDE PADDLE!", "WOBBLY!", etc.)
- **Sparkle particles**: Type-colored particle burst at collection point
- **Screen flash**: Brief colored flash (intensity/color varies by type)
- **HUD indicator**: Icon with countdown timer bar in bottom UI border, stack badges for Fireball

## 3. Meta / Progression

### Currency System
- Coins earned from score at end of game (win, lose, or quit)
- **Conversion formula**: `floor(sqrt(score) × 0.5)` + tier bonuses
- **Tier bonuses** (cumulative):
  - Score ≥ 1,000 → +5 coins
  - Score ≥ 5,000 → +10 coins
  - Score ≥ 10,000 → +20 coins
  - Score ≥ 25,000 → +30 coins
- Minimum 1 coin for any positive score
- Awarded on Game Over screen (animated count-up), or on quit-to-menu from pause
- Has `spendCurrency()` and `canAfford()` methods — **no shop exists yet** (see TODO)
- **Testability**: `CurrencyManager.resetInstance()` allows resetting the singleton between tests for proper localStorage integration testing

### High Score Leaderboard
- Top 5 scores stored locally in localStorage
- Sorted descending by score
- On new high score: 3-letter initials entry (keyboard input, A-Z only)
- Initials typed into individual boxes with blinking cursor

- Current game's score highlighted in gold on leaderboard
- Pure functions extracted to `src/utils/leaderboard.ts` for testability
- Tests: `src/utils/leaderboard.test.ts`

### Persistence (localStorage)
| Key | Contents |
|-----|----------|
| `genos-block-party-leaderboard` | Array of `{initials, score}` objects, sorted desc, max 5 |
| `genos-block-party-currency` | Integer string (total coins) |

---

## 6. Visual Systems

### Ball Effect System
- **BallEffectManager**: Manages multiple simultaneous particle effects per ball
- **Effect registry**: Extensible — add new effects by creating a handler class and registering it
- **Tint blending**: When multiple effects are active, their tint colors are blended using multiplicative blending
- **Depth layering**: Effects sorted by depth (Smoke → Trail → Ball → Sparkle → Fire Overlay → Glow)

#### Effect Handlers
| Effect | Layers | Behavior |
|--------|--------|----------|
| **Fireball** | Flame trail + overlay + smoke (lv3) | 3 intensity tiers, ball tint cycles orange, pulse at lv2+ |
| **Electric Trail** | Streak + crackle + blur glow + glints | 4-layer system, cyan tint shimmer every 60ms, fast vibrating pulse |
| **Disco Sparkle** | Light beams + mirror facets + glints + sparkles | Mirror ball aesthetic, metallic color shimmer, dramatic pulse |

### Particle System
- **Confetti burst**: 12 particles on brick destruction, colored to match brick type
- **Celebration streamers**: 5 streamer sources across screen on level clear
- **Danger sparks**: Red/orange spark trail following ball on last life
- **Fireball trail**: Level-scaled flame particles (managed by effect handler)
- **Smoke trail**: Dark particles behind fireball at level 3
- All particles use object pooling via Phaser's emitter system

### Screen Effects
- **Screen shake**: Camera shake on brick hit (30ms/0.002), brick destroy (50ms/0.004), fireball scaled by level
- **Screen flash**: Color flash on level clear (multi-color sequence: white then gold)
- **Slow motion**: Time scale reduction (0.7×) on entering danger mode, smooth transition in/out
- **Danger vignette**: Pulsing red border overlay when on last life (alpha 0.12 → 0.25)
- **Camera flash**: Red flash on life lost (200ms)

### Background System
- **CSS-based**: Full-viewport background rendered outside Phaser canvas

- **Gradient generation**: Radial gradient from lighter center to darker edges, derived from base hex color

### Transitions Between Scenes
- **TransitionManager** singleton orchestrates coordinated animations
- **Background transitions**: CSS whip animations (left, right, down) with configurable duration
- **Element exit styles**:
  - **Explode**: Elements burst outward from center with rotation
  - **Drop**: Elements fall with gravity + slight rotation
  - **Slide Out**: Elements slide off screen left/right
  - **Spiral**: Elements spiral toward center while shrinking
  - **Shatter**: Quick scale burst then collapse with rotation
- **Staggered timing**: Each element starts its animation slightly after the previous

## 8. CI / Testing

### Continuous Integration
- **GitHub Actions** workflow runs on every push to `master` and on pull requests targeting `master`
- **Node 22** (LTS) — pinned in CI to satisfy Vite 7's engine requirements
- Pipeline steps: `npm ci` → `npm run build` (TypeScript + Vite) → `npm run test:ci` (Vitest)
- Badge displayed in README for at-a-glance build status

### Test Framework
- **Vitest** — fast, Vite-native test runner with TypeScript support out of the box
- Browser API mocks (window, matchMedia, localStorage) provided via setup file
- Globals enabled (`describe`, `it`, `expect` available without imports)

### Smoke Test Coverage
| Test Suite | What It Validates |
|------------|-------------------|
| **Level Data** | All 10 levels have required fields, sequential IDs, positive speed multipliers, valid brick types/health/positions, no duplicate positions |
| **Power-Up Configs** | Every `PowerUpType` enum value has a matching `POWERUP_CONFIGS` entry with correct type, color, duration, dropWeight, and emoji |
| **Currency Conversion** | `CurrencyManager.calculateCurrencyFromScore()` returns correct values across all tier thresholds (0, 100, 1K, 5K, 10K, 25K scores) |
| **Currency Persistence** | `CurrencyManager` localStorage integration: loads on init, handles corrupted/negative values, saves after transactions, cross-session persistence, `resetCurrency()` behavior |
| **Brick Drop Chances** | Every `BrickType` has a `BRICK_DROP_CHANCES` entry between 0–1, with correct ordering (Present < Piñata < Balloon) |
| **Multiplier System** | `MultiplierSystem` initialization, increment with diminishing returns, max cap enforcement, decay mechanics (grace period, scaling), reset behavior, and score application |
| **Constants Validation** | All game constants in `config/Constants.ts` have sane values: positive dimensions, valid ranges (0–1 for volumes/probabilities), ascending tier thresholds, valid hex colors, positive scores/durations |
| **Drop Roll Probability** | Pure drop logic functions (`calculateDropChance`, `rollDrop`, `rollDropsForDamage`): base chances per brick type, Power Ball bonus (2× capped at 100%), AOE penalty (50%), debug override precedence, edge cases |
| **Paddle Collision** | Center/edge/clamped angle calculations return correct radian values |
| **Ball Launch** | `calculateLaunchVelocity()` returns angles within specified range, always upward (negative velocityY), magnitude matches input speed, handles edge cases (zero/negative/high speeds) |
| **Fireball Stacking** | `FireballState` functions: `reset()` initializes level 0, `incrementLevel()` increases by 1 (immutable), `isActive()` returns false at 0/true at 1+, `getDamage()` equals level, `getVisualTier()` maps levels to 4 tiers (0/1/2/3), `canPierce()` returns level ≥ brickHP, integration test covers full gameplay flow |

## 9. Utilities

### Weighted Random Selection
- **`src/utils/weightedSelection.ts`** — Pure, testable utility for weighted random selection
- `weightedSelect<T>(items, randomValue)` — Selects item based on weights and a provided random value (0-1)
- `getTotalWeight<T>(items)` — Convenience helper to sum item weights
- **Power-up selection** uses this utility with weights from `POWERUP_CONFIGS`
- Supports edge cases: zero weights, negative weights (treated as zero), empty arrays

## 10. Lifetime Stats & Milestones

### Lifetime Stats System
All-time player statistics are tracked and persisted to localStorage:

| Stat | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Bricks Destroyed** | Total number of bricks destroyed across all games |
| **Power-Ups Collected** | Total power-ups collected (by type breakdown available) |
| **Games Played** | Total number of game sessions started |
| **Time Played** | Cumulative play time in hours/minutes |
| **Highest Multiplier** | Best multiplier achieved |
| **Total Score** | Sum of all scores earned |
| **Highest Level** | Furthest level reached (1-10) |
| **Perfect Games** | Games completed without losing a life |

- Storage key: `geno_lifetime_stats`
- Accessible via **Stats** button on main menu

## 11. TODO / Known Gaps

### Unused Systems
- **`CURRENCY.AWARD_SCENE_DURATION` and `COUNT_UP_DURATION` constants** are defined but the award is handled inline in GameOverScene rather than a dedicated award scene.

### Missing Content
- **Level 10 has no dedicated music** — will inherit from whatever level the player was on before
- **No level background images verified** — system tries to load `art/levelN/bg.jpg` but falls back to gradient if missing
- **`BallEffectType.DANGER_SPARKS`** is defined in the enum but has no effect handler registered (danger sparks are handled directly by ParticleSystem instead of the effect system)
- **`BallEffectType.BALLOON_TRAIL`** commented out as a future effect — not implemented

### Partially Implemented
- **Audio manifest `bpm` and `loopPoint` fields** are defined in the type system but never read or used — intended for future beat-sync effects and seamless loop points
- **Mute toggle**: `AudioManager` has `setMuted()`/`toggleMute()` but there's no mute button in the UI (only volume sliders)

### Obvious Next Steps
- **More levels**: Level data system supports unlimited levels via the `LEVELS` array
- **Custom art assets**: All graphics are currently generated programmatically in BootScene — real sprite sheets would elevate the visual quality
- **Beat-sync effects**: BPM data exists in manifest for future rhythm-based visual effects
- **Leaderboard online**: Currently localStorage only — could integrate with a backend for global scores
- **More power-up types**: Effect system is registry-based and designed for easy extension (DJ Scratch added as latest example)
- **Accessibility**: No colorblind mode, no screen reader support beyond the "Now Playing" toast ARIA attributes
